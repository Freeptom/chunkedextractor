# Chunked Extractors

The chunked extractors project is a collection of three extractors.

1.  [ReVerb](http://reverb.cs.washington.edu/)--an extractor for verb-mediated relations (`Sally sells sea shells`).
2.  Relnoun--an extractor for noun-mediate relation (`United States president Barack Obama`).
3.  Nesty--an extractor for nested relations (`Some people say that we never landed on the moon`).

This project provides a common interface to the three extractors by using the
nlptools project for chunking and lemmatization.
